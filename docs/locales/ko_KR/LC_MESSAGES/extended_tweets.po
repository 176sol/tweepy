msgid ""
"Any ``tweepy.API`` method that returns a Status object accepts a new "
"``tweet_mode`` parameter. Valid values for this parameter are ``compat`` "
"and ``extended``, which give compatibility mode and extended mode, "
"respectively. The default mode (if no parameter is provided) is "
"compatibility mode."

"By default, using compatibility mode, the ``text`` attribute of Status "
"objects returned by ``tweepy.API`` methods is truncated to 140 "
"characters, as needed. When this truncation occurs, the ``truncated`` "
"attribute of the Status object will be ``True``, and only entities that "
"are fully contained within the available 140 characters range will be "
"included in the ``entities`` attribute. It will also be discernible that "
"the ``text`` attribute of the Status object is truncated as it will be "
"suffixed with an ellipsis character, a space, and a shortened self-"
"permalink URL to the Tweet."

"When using extended mode, the ``text`` attribute of Status objects "

"attribute, which contains the entire untruncated text of the Tweet. The "
"``truncated`` attribute of the Status object will be ``False``, and the "
"``entities`` attribute will contain all entities. Additionally, the "
"Status object will have a ``display_text_range`` attribute, an array of "

" sub-field/key of this dictionary will contain the full, untruncated text"

"When using extended mode with a Retweet, the ``full_text`` attribute of "
"the Status object may be truncated with an ellipsis character instead of "
"containing the full text of the Retweet. However, since the "
"``retweeted_status`` attribute (of a Status object that is a Retweet) is "
"itself a Status object, the ``full_text`` attribute of the Retweeted "
"Status object can be used instead."

"This also applies similarly to Status objects/payloads that are Retweets "
"from streams. The dictionary from the ``extended_tweet`` attribute/field "
"contains a ``full_text`` sub-field/key that may be truncated with an "

"the Retweeted Status (from the ``retweeted_status`` attribute/field) can "
