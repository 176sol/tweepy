"The Twitter streaming API is used to download twitter messages in real "
"time.  It is useful for obtaining a high volume of tweets, or for "
"creating a live feed using a site stream or user stream. See the `Twitter"
" Streaming API Documentation`_."

"The streaming api is quite different from the REST api because the REST "
"api is used to *pull* data from twitter but the streaming api *pushes* "
"messages to a persistent session. This allows the streaming api to "
"download more data in real time than could be done using the REST API."

"In Tweepy, an instance of **tweepy.Stream** establishes a streaming "
"session and routes messages to **StreamListener** instance.  The "
"**on_data** method of a stream listener receives all messages and calls "
"functions according to the message type. The default **StreamListener** "
"can classify most common twitter messages and routes them to "
"appropriately named methods, but these methods are only stubs."

"When using Twitter's streaming API one must be careful of the dangers of "
